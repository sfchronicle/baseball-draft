Explanation,"Each year Barry Bonds and Roger Clemons have been on the ballot, I have not voted for them. This year is different: after much deliberation, I came to the conclusion that with the top leadership of the sport from the steroid era going into the Hall of Fame along the best managers, the leading media members and several of the most prominent players, that it is time to stop holding two men accountable for the entire mess. Everyone in the game, including the media, was complicit in the PEDs scandals some degree, and the Hall of Fame appears to have come to some peace with the era. ","When steroid-era players began appearing on the ballot, I decided I needed either to reject the entire era or accept the entire era because nobody can say with certainty who did and did not use, particularly before testing began, and even now. I could not imagine a Hall that excluded a whole generation of players and from the outset have voted for Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens, who were the best of their era.","It’s my second year voting for Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens. I came around on Edgar Martinez. If closers can go to the Hall, so can a DH. I thought Vladimir Guerrero was a Hall of Famer when watching him play. Nothing has changed. I hesitated on Ivan Rodriguez, who lost 30 pounds once steroid testing began, but I voted for another catcher who played under a cloud, Mike Piazza. So Pudge is in. One final vote for Lee Smith, who’ll drop off the ballot.","I never vote for more than four or five players, always vote for Smith and Raines, changed my mind on Martinez this year and still don't vote for players with clear evidence and history of steroid use. ","Call me a lunatic, but I vote for the Hall of Fame as consistently as anyone in America. I voted for Bonds and other PED legends from the beginning. I don't waver on votes. I don't ""wait a while."" And I don't stop voting for someone. No ambiguity, no character judgments. It's all about the best players of their time. This is a museum, not a courtroom, and all the rogues should have their misdeeds clearly stated on their Cooperstown plaques.","The ballot, put together by Hall-of-Fame officials (not writers), asks voters to consider “integrity, sportsmanship and character.” If that’s our guide, the decision is clear: Steroid users tarnished the integrity of competition (in this context, much worse than personal integrity) and do not deserve a spot in the Hall. It’s a murky process to identify likely PED users, obviously, but I go by the standards of a civil trial – if there’s a “preponderance of evidence,” I won’t vote for a player. ",,,
